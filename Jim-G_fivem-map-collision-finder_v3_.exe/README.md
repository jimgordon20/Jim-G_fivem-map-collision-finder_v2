Jim-G FiveM Map Collision Checker

This tool is based on Jim-G_fivem-map-collision-finder_v2_.bat,
but compiled into an easy-to-use .exe with a custom GUI and improved .lua print output.

ðŸš€ How to Use

Download and unzip the release package.

Open the .exe file.

Add the file path to the folder containing your MLO.

Try not to include script folders in the same path. (A check is included, but sometimes they may still appear.)

Select the options you want to scan for â€” ymap, ybn, lod, light, ext, etc.

Choose your output path.

The tool will generate either an .html or .lua report after scanning.

Review your results.

You can easily switch between .html and .lua outputs and print both if needed.

ðŸ§  Notes

The .exe version is designed for easier use â€” no manual batch editing required.

Output readability and reporting have been improved for faster debugging.
